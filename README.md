# Final degree project - University of Alcal√° 

## Study and Developmetn of an operating system for microcontroller based on CORTEX-M3.
This project aims to create an operating system for microcontrollers based on the Cortex-M3 architecture that provides the user, as well as the hardware itself, with operational guarantees that maintain security and optimum efficiency when managing microcontroller resources.
To do this, we start from the base of an existing operating system for these microcontrollers, such as RTX, an RTOS (Real-Time Operating System) developed for ARM and Cortex-M devices.
The objective will be the programming of the characteristics of the board with which we will work, within this operating system; giving it the ability to manage resources within the applications with which the user goes to work.
